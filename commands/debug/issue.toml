prompt = """
You are looping on bad fixes. Stop proposing code changes right now.

First — answer ONLY these 4 short points:

1. One sentence: What is actually still broken right now?
2. Top 2-3 most likely root causes we haven't disproved yet.
3. 2-4 files / locations / functions that are still suspicious.
4. Single cheapest/fastest next debug step we haven't really tried properly.

Keep each answer very short and direct.

Only after these 4 points are you allowed to suggest any code change, tool call or edit.
